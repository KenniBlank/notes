## Local Documentation and Version Update

To access local documentation, use the following command:
```bash
rustup doc
```
To update to the latest version of Rust, use:
```bash
rustup update
```
To check the version of Rust running, use:
```bash
rustc --version
```

Book
```bash
rustup doc --book
```

## Macros
***
In Rust, a macro is a pre-defined sequence of automated input designed to streamline repetitive tasks. To call a macro, use the `!` symbol. For example:
```rs
macro_name!(arguments);
```
Note that macros don't always follow the same rules as functions.

## Cargo
***
Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. Here are some key features and commands:

### Creating a New Project

To create a new project, use:
```bash
cargo new folder_name
```
This command creates a new folder with a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src` folder containing a `main.rs` file. It also generates a new Git repository along with a `.gitignore` file.

### Building and Running a Project

To build a project, use:
```bash
cargo build
```
To run a project, use:
```bash
cargo run
```
Alternatively, you can build and run a project in one step using:
```bash
cargo run
```

### Checking for Errors

To check for errors without creating a binary, use:
```bash
cargo check
```
This command quickly checks the code to make sure it compiles but doesn't produce an executable.

### Building for Release

To build a project for release, use:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
This command compiles the project with optimization and creates an executable in the `target/release` directory.

# Syntax and Learning
***
### Input/Output Library

To obtain user input and print output, you need to import the `io` library into scope using:
```rs
use std::io;
```
By default, Rust brings a set of items defined in the standard library into the scope of every program, known as the prelude.

### Variables

In Rust, variables are declared using the `let` keyword and are immutable by default. To make a variable mutable, use the `mut` keyword. For example:
```rs
let apples = 5;
let mut bananas = 5;
```
### Data Types

Rust is a statically typed language, which means it must know the data type of all variables at compile time. The language has four primary scalar types:

* Integers

* Floating-point numbers

* Booleans

* Characters

### Basic Numeric Operations

Here's an example of basic numeric operations in Rust:
```rs
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```
### Compound Types

Rust has two compound types:

* Tuples
* Arrays

Tuples have a fixed length and can be declared using the following syntax:
```rs
let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
```
Arrays have a fixed length and can be declared using the following syntax:
```rs
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
Note that every element of an array must have the same type.

## Variables and Mutability

In Rust, variables are immutable by default. To make a variable mutable, use the `mut` keyword. For example:
```rs
let mut x = 5;
```
To make a variable immutable forever, use the `const` keyword. For example:
```rs
const Y: u32 = 60;
```
Note that `const` and `mut` are different in that `const` makes a variable immutable forever, while `mut` makes a variable mutable.

### Shadowing

Rust allows shadowing, which means you can declare a new variable with the same name as an existing variable. For example:
```rs
let x = 3;
let x = x + 1; // this overshadows the value of previous declaration
```
